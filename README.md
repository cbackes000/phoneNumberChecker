# phoneNumberChecker
Takes in text file and separates into a list by newline characters.
Checks each entry for invalid characters or string length 
(mostly just for valid phone numbers)

Default Check will search for any non-digit characters.

To-do:

add check for numbers NOT starting with 1

somehow check for () and - properly based on entries (ex: (913)-192-0918 would be valid)

blah blah blah
